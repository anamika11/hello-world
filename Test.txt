#Similar to lIst , but once u create it cannot be changed. Ite IMMutable

ourtuple=1,2,3,"A","B"

print(type(ourtuple))
ourtuple=(1,2,3,"A","B")  # Iterable datatype, means made up of little pieces called element, we can select each element and slices of element as sting and list
print(ourtuple[0:3])

## We get error when trying to change an element
#ourtuple[2]=5


# Convert list/Stinrg to tuple using tuple()
A=[1,2,3]
tuple(A)
print(type(A))
